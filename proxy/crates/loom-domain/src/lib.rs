//! Shared domain types for the Loom proxy workspace.
//!
//! These are the wire-facing data transfer objects (DTOs) that the macOS UI
//! consumes via `/api/*`. They are pure data: no I/O, no async, and no
//! dependency on any other workspace crate. Keeping them here gives every
//! service a single, authoritative definition of the model and is the basis
//! for the generated OpenAPI contract (see docs/architecture).
//!
//! Field names serialize as-is (snake_case), which the UI relies on
//! (e.g. `step_name`, `request_id`).
